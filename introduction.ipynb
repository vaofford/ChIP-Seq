    "The goal of this hands-on session is to perform the basic steps of the analysis of ChIP-Seq data, as well as some downstream analysis. \n",

    "At the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * generate an unspliced alignment by aligning raw sequencing data to the human genome using **[Bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml)**\n",
    "  * manipulate the SAM output in order to visualise the alignment on the **[IGV](http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/)** browser\n",
    "  * based on the aligned reads, find immuno-enriched areas using the peak caller **[MACS2](https://github.com/taoliu/MACS)**\n",
    "  * perform functional annotation and motif analysis on the predicted binding regions\n",

    "The data we will use for this practical comes from the [**ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) Consortium**](https://www.encodeproject.org/), a big international collaboration aimed at building a comprehensive catalogue of functional elements in the human genome. As part of this project, many human tissues and cell lines were studied using high-throughput sequencing technologies.\n",

    "In this practical, we will work on datasets from, [**GM12878**](https://www.genome.gov/26524238/encode-project-common-cell-types/), a lymphoblastoid cell line produced from the blood of a female donor of European ancestry. Specifically, we will look at binding data for the transcription factor **PAX5**. PAX5 is a known regulator of B-cell differentiation. Aberrant expression of PAX5 is linked to lymphoblastoid leukaemia. If there is time, we will also look at ChIP-seq data for **Polymerase II** and the histone modification **H3K36me3**."
